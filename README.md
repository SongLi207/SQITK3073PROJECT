# SQITK3073PROJECT

SQIT 3073: Business Analytic Programming Group Project -  30% Marks


Tasks:

1. You are required to form a group 
2. Each group must develop

An analytic web dashboard/model which includes (1) data retrieval and (2) development of quantitative modelling. Example of analytic system includes;

- Prediction of stock market based on yahoo finance (use of API) using machine learning
- House selection / Car selection using preferences
- Etc.

Dataset:

If youâ€™re dealing with a Machine Learning type of project, you can use the API or Beautifulsoup / Scrapy library. You can also retrieve other dataset such as:
https://open.dosm.gov.my/ 
https://apikijangportal.bnm.gov.my/
https://data.gov.my/
https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
other open dataset platform

Bonus marks will be given to projects that utilise web scraping/API, the use of SQL and visualisation. Hence the use of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Numpy and other libraries are an added advantage. Extra points would also be given to projects that possess either commercial value or impact to the community to use. 

Deliverables:

- Brief Technical Report (Introduction, Problem, Solution, Methodology/Workflow, Result, Conclusion)
- Presentation Slide
- Python Source Code in Github

Submission Date 	: Week 14
Presentation Date 	: Week 14

Assessment will be conducted on the group based on report writing, programming work and presentation.
